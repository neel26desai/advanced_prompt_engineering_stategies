# advanced_prompt_engineering_stategies

In this repository we demonstrate ,vaarious mordern prompt engineering techniques and their implemtation with OpenAI and Gemini through their own apis and by using their respective langchain wrappers.

## Files and Thier Content

1. Prompt_Engineering_Techniques.ipynb: In this notebook we demonstrate uuse of various morder prompting techniques sucjas  ICL, COT, ReAct etc

2. PromptTemplates.ipynb: In this notebook we have build 21 different prompt template to demonstrate the template of prompt that ca be used for one shot classfication, language translation etc.

3. Prompts_for_10_diverse_fields.ipynb: In this notebook we have written 3 prompt templates each for 10 different domains, to make the application is LLMs to those fields.

4. Gemini_Palm2.ipynb:In this notebook I have demonstrated how can you implement Open AI prompt examples from https://platform.openai.com/, using gemini/plamn using langchain.

5. FunctionCalling_WithOpenAI.ipynb: In this notebook I demonstrated how to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities

6. DemonstrateEffectiveness_of_SystemPrompts.ipynb: I this notebook I demonstrate how different System prompt provide different response for the same prompt, and for a gie prompt, what type of system prompt should you use.
